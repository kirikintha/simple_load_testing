simple_load_testing
===================

This uses bees with machine guns, and a simple ab tester - let's you output log files. Nothing fancy!

##Warning

Bees With Machine Guns and Apache Bench are meant for testing development and staging environments. BWMG especially can be costly, if you don't know what you are doing.
When in doubt - be very, very careful and use the simple test.
I make no warranty on this, nor do I encourage anything but responsible use.
